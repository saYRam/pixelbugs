What is this project all about?
===============================
Basically, I've been reading the book "Head First Design Patterns" which is really 
very good. The samples in the book are all in Java, so I thought I'd recreate the
samples in C# and I'll write them test first. So for each pattern I read about, I'll
add the pattern sample to this solution. 

The projects here are only samples and are not applications in their own right. I may 
create my own samples to help me solidify my understanding.

I hope this is useful to other developers who are reading this excellent book. You can 
preview the book on Google Books here:
