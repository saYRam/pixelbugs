You will need:
	nant beta: 0.86
	empty database on localhost called pixelbugs_testing (for unit tests)

When you first check out the solution run a clean build by executing "nant" in 
the src directory. This will create the AssemblyInfo.cs files with the correct 
version number.

To disable tests: 
	nant -D:common.testrunner.enabled=false
  
To specify Nunit categories to exclude (case-sensitive): 
	nant -D:common.testrunner.categoryexclusions=category names

To perform a release build
	nant -D:project.config=release
  
To perform a clean
	nant clean
  
To perform a rebuild
	nant rebuild
  
To generate documentation
	nant releaseDocs
	
You can combine targets too. To rebuild, run tests with coverage report (excluding Integration tests) and generate documentation:
	nant -D:common.testrunner.categoryexclusions=Integration rebuild releaseDocs
